The REST API is made using Node.js and express.js.
The code for the API is locates in /app.js

The user Interface is made using Jade template, and is located in the file /views/index.jade
	The stylesheet is defined in the file /public/stylesheets/custom.css

 
The MV* framework used in the fronted is Backbone.js
The ability to reassign the objects to different groups dynamically calls for storing the data in models linked to views, hence I used backbone.
	All the Javascript/backbone functions defined by me are located in /public/stylesheets/functions.js
